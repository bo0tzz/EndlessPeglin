# Endless Peglin

This is a mod for Peglin that prevents your progress 
(relics and orb deck) from being reset when you start a new game,
thus allowing you to loop endlessly while becoming ridiculously strong.

This mod is imperfect and comes with no warranties. It may break your game,
prevent you from creating new savefiles, crash your computer, or set your house on fire.  
If it does so, please don't blame the wonderful Peglin devs for it! If anything 
about the game breaks, consider that it might be caused by this (or another) mod,
and make a note of that if you decide to report a bug to the Peglin team.

## Installation guide
1. Install the BepInEx modloader according to [this guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
2. Download the EndlessPeglin.dll file [from the latest release](https://github.com/bo0tzz/EndlessPeglin/releases/latest/download/EndlessPeglin.dll)
4. Place EndlessPeglin.dll in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder, inside the game folder

Enjoy :)
